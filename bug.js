In Next.js, an uncommon error can occur when using server-side props (`getServerSideProps`) or static generation (`getStaticProps`) with data fetching that depends on the request headers (e.g., `req.headers`).  This happens because these functions run on the server, and the request object (`req`) is not always populated with the expected headers in development environments or when using caching mechanisms. This might lead to unexpected behavior or data inconsistencies between the development environment and the production environment.  For example, if your data fetching relies on a custom header for authentication or localization, it might fail during development or when the Next.js cache is in use.

```javascript
// pages/index.js
export async function getServerSideProps({ req }) {
  const authToken = req.headers.authorization;
  // ... fetch data using authToken ...
  return { props: { data } };
}
```

# Next.js Data Fetching Inconsistencies with Request Headers

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Next.js related to data fetching inconsistencies when using `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` and relying on request headers. The issue arises because the request object (`req`) might not be properly populated with headers in development or when caching is involved, leading to differences between development and production behavior.

## Bug Description

The core problem is that using `req.headers` within `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` can lead to unexpected results, particularly during local development or when Next.js's caching mechanisms are used.  This is because the request object may be missing headers in these scenarios.

## Reproduction

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code.  Run `npm install` and then `npm run dev` to see the issue in development mode.

## Solution

The solution, provided in `bugSolution.js`, demonstrates using environment variables and contexts to make the application work consistently across different environments.  This method isolates the headers logic and avoids direct dependency on the request object.
